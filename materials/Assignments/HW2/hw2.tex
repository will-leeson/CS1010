\subsection*{Problem 1 (5 Pts)}
Below is a network to predict whether or not I should leave my house. If the output is greater than 0, I will, otherwise I won't. The inputs are the temperature (in Fahrenheit) and how cute my cat is looking (on a scale of 1 to 10). Currently, it is $10^{\circ}$F, but my cat has decided to sing the song of his people, so he's a 2 on the cute scale. Using the network and this input, calculate the value for each neuron and tell me if I should go outside:
