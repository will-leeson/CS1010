\question[5] The following network has been trained to predict how many peppers will grow on a plant by September based on the hardiness zone and month it was planted in. I'm going to plant my peppers in Charlottesville (zone 7) in May (month 5). Using this network, calculate the value of each neuron based on how I'm planting my pepper plant and tell me how many peppers I should expect based on the network's output.
