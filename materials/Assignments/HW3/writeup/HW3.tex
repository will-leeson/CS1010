\section*{Description}
On collab, there are two files for HW3: this file HW3.pdf and HW3.py. To receive full credit, complete
all three challenges listed in HW3.py and answer each accompanying question on HW3.pdf. Submit
both the code and write-up on collab. You are allowed to discuss the programming challenges with
your classmates and use resources, like the internet, for help, but you must write your own code.
If you discuss problems with a classmate, please list their name on the Collaborator’s line on HW3.py
(line 3). If you use any resources, please list them on the resources line. If it’s a website, provide
the link
