# Introduction to Information Technology

## What is the course?
CS 1010 is an introductory course meant to introduce students outside of the computer science major to core concepts in computer science. Computers are powerful tools which can be used across all disciplines for automating tasks. While not everyone will be creating or maintaining these systems, they will most likely interact with someone who will. It is important to understand what these systems and the people interacting with them are capable of. The ultimate goal of this course is to give students an understanding of computers so they can identify when and how computers can help.

## What isn't this course?
This is NOT a substitute for an introductory programming course. We will cover the very basics of programming, but the purpose of the course is not to build up and test your programming abilities. Instead, we will talk about programming in a conceptual way and do some light programming so you can get a sense of what is possible.

## What topics will be covered?
- What is a computer and how does it work?
- Using the internet as a tool to solve problems
- What is programming? What can it do?
